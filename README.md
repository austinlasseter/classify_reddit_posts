## DATA SOURCE
* Hosted scraper on AWS EC2
* 1,000 posts every 6 hours
* Ran for 5 days
* Collected 37,000 posts
* Reduced to 5,300 unique

## DATA COMPONENTS
* Title of Post
* Subreddit
* Length of Time
* Number of Comments

### Natural Language Processing
* We call “vectorization” the process of turning text into numbers so that we can predict an outcome
* Using this count vectorization we can predict what text is likely to engage readers more!

## Modeling
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
